{#1. Ordered Lists (<ol>) and Unordered Lists (<ul>)#}
{#Why We Need Them:#}
{#Ordered lists present items in a sequence (numbered), which is important when the order matters (such as steps in instructions or rankings). Unordered lists, on the other hand, display items with bullet points when the order is not significant. Both types enhance readability and structure.#}
{#Where to Use Them:#}
{#Ordered lists: Instructions, recipes, procedures, or any content where the sequence is key.#}
{#Unordered lists: Lists of features, ingredients, tips, or items without a defined order.#}
